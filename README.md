# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Antonio Logan**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Ditto Viewer** is an android app that uses the PokéAPI to fetch data about Ditto and display its key stats, including name, type, and base experience. Each time the button is pressed, the app makes a new API request and refreshes the information shown on screen.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🐾📱✨**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request  
  - The query I added is **N/A (not implemented for this project)**  
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/)**.

## Notes

Here's a place for any other notes on the app, it's creation process, or what you learned this unit!

I got more comfortable working with AsyncHTTPClient, JSON parsing, and updating the UI from API responses. I also spent time troubleshooting Gradle and AndroidX configuration issues, which helped me better understand how Android projects are structured under the hood.
